**Task: Implement GraphQL CRUD Operations for Users, Posts, and Comments**

**Objective:**
Create a GraphQL API that enables CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing users, posts, and comments.

**Scope:**
This task involves setting up a Node.js server with Apollo Server and Prisma for building the GraphQL API. The API should provide the following functionalities:

**User Management:**

1. Create a new user with a name and email.
2. Retrieve a list of all users.
3. Retrieve a user by their unique ID.
4. Update user information (name and email) by their ID.
5. Delete a user by their ID.

**Post Management:**

1. Create a new post with a title, content, and an associated author (user).
2. Retrieve a list of all posts.
3. Retrieve a post by its unique ID.
4. Update post information (title and content) by its ID.
5. Delete a post by its ID.

**Comment Management:**

1. Create a new comment with content, an associated author (user), and an associated post.
2. Retrieve a list of all comments.
3. Retrieve a comment by its unique ID.
4. Update a comment's content by its ID.
5. Delete a comment by its ID.

**Data Relationships:**

- Users can have multiple posts and comments.
- Posts can have multiple comments.

**Technology Stack:**

- Node.js for server-side development.
- Apollo Server for building the GraphQL API.
- Prisma for database interaction.
- GraphQL for defining and querying the API schema.
- A relational database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) for storing user, post, and comment data.

**Usage:**

- The GraphQL API should be accessible via HTTP, allowing clients to send queries and mutations to interact with user, post, and comment data.
- API consumers can use GraphQL clients (e.g., Apollo Client) or tools like GraphQL Playground to interact with the API.

**Benefits:**

- Provides a flexible and efficient way to perform CRUD operations on user-generated content.
- Allows for easy integration into various client applications, including web and mobile.
- Ensures data consistency and integrity through well-defined schema and database models.
- Facilitates efficient data retrieval through GraphQL queries tailored to specific needs.

**Future Enhancements:**

- Implement user authentication and authorization for securing sensitive operations.
- Add pagination and filtering capabilities for efficient data retrieval.
- Enhance error handling and validation for robustness.
- Implement real-time updates using GraphQL subscriptions for a dynamic user experience.

**Note:** This task outlines the core features and technologies for implementing GraphQL CRUD operations for users, posts, and comments. The actual implementation may involve additional details and considerations based on project requirements and goals.
